A Room Name
A room name cannot be assigned to more than one room.
Each name can be at max 8 characters long, with only uppercase and lowercase letters allowed (thus, no numbers, special characters, or spaces). This restriction is not extended to the room file's filename.
You must hard code a list of ten different Room Names into your rooms program and have your rooms program randomly assign one of these to each room generated. Thus, for a given run of your rooms program, 7 of the 10 hard-coded room names will be used.

A Room Type
The possible room type entries are: START_ROOM, END_ROOM, and MID_ROOM.
The assignment of which room gets which type should be randomly generated each time the rooms program is run.
Naturally, only one room should be assigned the START_ROOM type, and only one room should be assigned the END_ROOM type. The rest of the rooms will receive the MID_ROOM type.

Outbound connections to other rooms
There must be at least 3 outbound connections and at most 6 outbound connections from this room to other rooms.
The oubound connections from one room to other rooms should be assigned randomly each time the rooms program is run.
Outbound connections must have matching connections coming back: if room A connects to room B, then room B must have a connection back to room A. Because of all of these specs, there will always be at least one path through.
A room cannot have an outbound connection that points to itself.
A room cannot have more than one outbound connection to the same room.
